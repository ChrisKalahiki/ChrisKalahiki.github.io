# Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

## Ruger Bot
A bot made for my personal Discord server, but made it open-source for everyone to try.
- **Technologies**: Python, Discord API
- **GitHub**: [Link to Repository]

## Street Sign Classification
One of my first machine learning models was a CNN model for identifying street signs.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Computer Vision
- **Description**: Developed a convolutional neural network to classify different types of street signs for potential autonomous vehicle applications.

## Machine Learning Research Projects

### Computer Vision for Inventory Management Systems
- My master's thesis work developing computer vision solutions for inventory tracking.
- **Technologies**: Python, OpenCV, Deep Learning

### Explainable Machine Learning Models
- Research on making black-box machine learning models more interpretable.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

### AI for Games
- Developed intelligent agents for game environments.
- **Technologies**: Reinforcement Learning, Python

### Generative Models
- Projects exploring generative models for art and music creation.
- **Technologies**: GANs, VAEs, PyTorch
