# Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

## Recommending IDEs to Developers using Sentiment Analysis and Stack Overflow Tags
Created a complete pipeline for recommending interactive development environments based on sentiment analysis on Stack Overflow posts leveraging the tagging system to analyze relationships between users and posts.
- **Technologies**: Python, Jupyter Notebooks

## Ruger Bot
A bot made for my personal Discord server, but made it open-source for everyone to try.
- **Technologies**: Python, Discord API
- **GitHub**: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/ChrisKalahiki/ruger-bot)

## Image Clustering with Discrete Wavelet Transform on CT Scans
Performed Image clustering on CT scans while exercising texture analysis and feature extraction through the use of Discrete Wavelet Transform.
- **Technologies**: Python, Scikit-Learn
- **GitHub**: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/ChrisKalahiki/CT-Image-Analysis-using-DWT)

## Street Sign Classification
One of my first machine learning models was a CNN model for identifying street signs.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Computer Vision
- **Description**: Developed a convolutional neural network to classify different types of street signs for potential autonomous vehicle applications.
- **GitHub**: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/ChrisKalahiki/CNN-for-BelgiumTS-and-MNIST)

## Machine Learning Research Projects

### Computer Vision for Inventory Management Systems
- My master's thesis work developing computer vision solutions for inventory tracking.
- **Technologies**: Python, OpenCV, Deep Learning

### Explainable Machine Learning Models
- Research on making black-box machine learning models more interpretable.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

### AI for Games
- Developed intelligent agents for game environments.
- **Technologies**: Reinforcement Learning, Python
